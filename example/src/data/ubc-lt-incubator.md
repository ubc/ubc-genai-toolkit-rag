# Information on UBC's Learning Technology Incubator

The Learning Technology (LT) Incubator supports funded UBC learning technology projects by housing their software development within the LT Hub. The instructor(s) for each project work closely with the LT Incubator development team, and guide the strategy of the project by acting as product owners.

The LT Incubator invites instructors to partner with the LT Hub to grow their learning technology ideas with less administrative overhead.

## Instructors Act as Product Owners

-   Rather than instructors having to fill the roles of hiring manager and technical team lead for their projects, they can focus on being product owners. A product owner is a software development role that is deeply embedded within the development team, but does not handle hiring or management. Instead, the product owner sets the direction for the learning technology and its technical priorities:
-   The product owner identifies user stories (that is, what users want to be able to do with the learning technology), defines what completion looks like for each user story, and prioritizes developing these within the project.
-   The product owner works in a close feedback loop with the LT Incubator team lead and developers, deciding which project features will be done first, which can wait, and when each should be rolled out.

In short, the product owner is the strategic thinker for the project.

## The LT Incubator Manages the Development Team

To get development working quickly and efficiently, the LT Incubator hires all the developers (in consultation with the product owners), deals with the human resources side, and manages the team in UBCâ€™s Workday system.
Key areas of assistance

-   Technical expertise: The LT Incubator team lead will make recommendations on tool architecture, platform, and implementation strategy. As the project grows, the team lead will also be able to guide development with a view to long-term sustainability and scaling up.
-   Hiring & managing: Instead of instructors hiring developers themselves, the LT Incubator team lead will hire the developers and then manage their development tasks for the project. The hiring will align with the philosophies/guidelines of the funding (e.g., Teaching and Learning Enhancement Fund aka TLEF), meaning that the developers can and likely will be students. This approach will fulfill the vision of funds like TLEF to engage students in enhancing teaching and learning at UBC.
-   Privacy & security: The LT Incubator team will also handle all required learning technology-related approvals (such as UBC Privacy Impact Assessments) and assurances that information security standards are being met.

## Limitations

Partnering with the LT Incubator does not necessarily mean that a project will be centrally adopted, supported, or funded as part of the UBC learning technology ecosystem after the project funding runs out. But the benefit of partnering with the LT Incubator is being able to build your learning technology ideas in a way that potential technical barriers to broader adoption are addressed as part of the development process. This approach will better position projects for participation in the UBC learning technology pilot process, which is a key requirement of broader adoption into the learning technology ecosystem.
